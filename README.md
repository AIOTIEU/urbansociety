## AIOTI Urban Society Portfolio

The focus of the **Urban Society working group of [AIOTI](aioti.eu)** will mainly be on Urban Societies and its Communities, but of course rural areas will be included. Urban Society is cross-cutting by integrating and touching all domains, not only the horizontals but also the vertical domains are intertwined with Urban Society.

Aligned with the vision of the European Commission, the main objective is to implement a human-centric approachin which societal challenges are the drivers pushing forward smart solutions, an approach different than the conversant technical-centric vision. The main objective is to increase the drivers of success, to gain more solid footing, to overcome big blockades and last but not least to do the right thing for our ecosystem of people, society, ecology and economy. 

We will do so by linking to related digital areas like public services, digital privacy, cybersecurity and healthy living focusing on the three main pillars of the European Commission: **more green, more digital and more resilient**. While in the midst of the pandemic, today and tomorrow, now more than ever, we need to think how to rebuild and reboot our cities and communities.

We have the power to make the difference with the AIOTI community. Let’s not forget how much difference we can make, not only for Europe but cross borders.We are on a mission; Let’s (re-)build a more resilient, greener, digital and healthier Post Covid Urban Society.We invite you to Team Up.
