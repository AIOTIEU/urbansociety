With  Ubiwhere’s **Smart  Waste  Management  System**,  it  is  simpler  to  manage the urban waste collection in cities. Through the placement of sensors with low energy  consumption  and  high  durability  in  the  traditional  trash  bins,  it  is possible  to  keep  tight  control  on  the  state of  the  container,  its  location  and security,   thus   increasing   the   effectiveness   and   efficiency   of   the   waste management teams.
