details: 'ACCRA produced a Methodology Handbook (for agile cocreation of robots for ageing), called LIFE. The goal of the LIFE methodology is to bring together robotics developers, engineers, stakeholders and end-users to cocreate robotics solutions that are more meaningful to end-users, in particular on specific targets such as the elderly. The originality of this methodology is that it seeks to bring together two very different entities: robotics and the elderly with a loss of autonomy. The central axis of this agile cocreation methodology is to position the elderly user at the very heart of the development of robotic solutions.<br><img src="/images/trialog_accra.png"/>'

The objective of the ACCRA robotic solutions is to improve or maintain the level of autonomy, to secure the daily lives and to promote the maintenance of socialisation of the elderly people with loss of autonomy.

The mission of ACCRA is to enable the development of advanced ICT Robotics based solutions for extending active and healthy ageing in daily life by defining, developing and demonstrating an agile co-creation development process.
