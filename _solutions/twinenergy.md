next_steps: 'Action is taking place in four pilot sites: Bristol (United Kingdom), Benetutti (Italy), Steinheim (Germany) and Athens (Greece). Each demonstration stands up for providing emergent technologies such as smart contracts, smart plugs and intelligent and personalised Demand Response programmes which are used by participants and installed in their homes.'

H2020 project whose objective is to test how digital twin technology can help a more active participation of energy consumers and help them become prosumers. To do so, a suite of innovative tools to predict citizensâ€™ consumption patterns and their comfort preferences are developed, analysing the flexibility potential that individuals, buildings and communities can provide to the electrical grid thus maximising their aggregated value.
