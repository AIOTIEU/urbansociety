status: Project finished
details: 'This experience analyses Edge controlled/assisted system with Multiaccess Edge Computing based approach O-RAN (Transforming the Radio Access Networks Industry Towards Open, Intelligent, Virtualized and Fully Interoperable RAN)
Cloud, 5G, IOT, Edge computing, MQTT, ORAN<br><br>Intelligent edge: Pervasive services, through which users can get real-time, personalized assistance and experiences Need of automatic real-time optimization of heterogeneous resources and fast configurations optimally selecting network functions and AI techniques'
partners: INFN TTLab. Unibo DEI, BiRex Pilot Plant
next_steps: The processing of large amount of data could benefit from the use of MEC (multi-access edge computing) instead of uploading data to the cloud which could cause additional roundtrip delay. The low latency is a key requirement in this experience

This experience produced a full workflow of data collection from a laser sensor
connected to a mobile application, working as edge device, which subsequently
transmits the data to a Cloud platform for analysing and processing data. Sensor. Cloud, 5G, IOT, Edge computing, MQTT
