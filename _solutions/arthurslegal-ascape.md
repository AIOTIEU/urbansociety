details: The role of ASCAPE is to support the Patient by providing actionable information to their Doctor. This way, the role of the Doctor is not replaced, but rather, is supplemented and enhanced, by the use of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data. These are delivered in an appropriate, fit-for-purpose environment, which safeguards patient data privacy, security and anonymity, and promotes a balanced relationship between Patients and Doctors.

ASCAPE is a EU Horizon2020 project that uses AI and big data for the developments of
solutions for cancer treatment. Throughout four pilots, data that are collected through
questionnaires or wearable devices are used through the Healthcare Information System to
make more accurate diagnosis, to predict the future health status of patients, and to take
medical action accordingly.
