RESPOND-A is a EU Horizon2020 project that introduces a unique five-tier project architectural structure for best associating modern telecommunications technology with novel practices for First Responders of saving lives, while safeguarding themselves, more effectively and efficiently. The introduced architecture includes Perception, Network, Processing, Comprehension, and User Interface layers, which can be flexibly elaborated to support multiple levels and types of customization, so as, the intended technologies and practices can adapt to any European Environment Agency (EEA)-type disaster scenario. The interrelation of the architectural layers is illustrated below. <br><br><img src="/images/vicomtech_responda_chart.png"/>
